# University: Adaptive Learning Platform

## 1. The Problem
First-year Calculus had a 40% failure rate (DFW rate).

## 2. The Approach
Implemented an Adaptive Learning platform that used Knowledge Tracing (BKT) to personalize homework.

## 3. Architecture
*   **LMS:** Canvas.
*   **Plugin:** LTI 1.3 tool written in Python.
*   **Algorithm:** BKT model updating student state after every question.

## 4. Outcomes
*   **Pass Rate:** Improved from 60% to 78%.
*   **Equity:** The "Achievement Gap" between prepared and unprepared students narrowed significantly.

## 5. Lessons Learned
*   **Teacher Agency:** Professors initially hated the "Black Box" grading. The team added a "Teacher Override" button to manually adjust grades, which built trust.
