# External Certification: ISO and Healthcare Certifications

A self-signed certificate is worthless. We need external validation.

## ISO/IEC 42001 (AIMS)

Released in late 2023, this is the first global standard for an **Artificial Intelligence Management System (AIMS)**.
*   **Not a Tech Check:** It doesn't certify the *model*. It certifies the *process*.
*   **Requirements:** Do you have a Risk Policy? Do you have a Training Record? Do you have an Incident Log?
*   **The Badge:** Companies will soon display "ISO 42001 Certified" as a badge of trust, just like ISO 27001 for security.

## Healthcare: SaMD (Software as a Medical Device)

*   **FDA Clearance (510k):** Proving your AI is "substantially equivalent" to an existing legal device.
*   **De Novo:** If it's a new technology, you must prove safety and efficacy from scratch via clinical data.

Certification is the bridge between "Move Fast and Break Things" and "regulated industry."
