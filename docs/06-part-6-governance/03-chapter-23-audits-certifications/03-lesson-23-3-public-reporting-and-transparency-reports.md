# Public Reporting and Transparency Reports

If you hide your failures, you earn suspicion. If you own them, you earn trust.

## The Transparency Report (Big Tech Style)
Social media companies publish reports: "We removed 1M hate speech posts." AI companies must do the same.
*   **The Metrics:**
    *   "Number of users declined for service."
    *   "Number of safety violations triggered."
    *   "Demographic breakdown of performance."
*   **The Narrative:** Case studies of difficult decisions. "We grappled with this edge case, and here is why we decided to block it."

## Incident Disclosure

When a bank is hacked, they must notify customers. When an AI fails, we need equivalent disclosure.
*   **CVEs for AI:** The cybersecurity community uses Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) numbers. We are building a similar database for AI Models (AIVE).
*   **The "Post-Mortem" Blog Post:** A detailed technical explanation of an outage or a bias incident, published openly to the engineering community.

Sunlight is the only way to normalize AI in society.
