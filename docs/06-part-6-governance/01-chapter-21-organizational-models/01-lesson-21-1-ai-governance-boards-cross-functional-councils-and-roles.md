# AI Governance Boards, Cross-Functional Councils, and Roles

Who owns AI risk? If the answer is "Everyone," then the answer is "No one." Governance requires defined roles.

## The AI Ethics Council

This is not a theoretical debating club; it is a decision-making body with veto power.

*   **Composition:** It must be cross-functional.
    *   **Technical:** Chief Scientist (Understands what is possible).
    *   **Legal:** General Counsel (Understands liability).
    *   **Ethical/Societal:** External experts or Civil Rights officers (Understands impact).
    *   **Business:** Product VP (Understands trade-offs).
*   **Mandate:** The Council reviews "High Risk" projects at the Concept Phase (before code is written) and the Launch Phase (before public release).

## The Role of the Chief AI Officer (CAIO)

A new C-suite role is emerging to bridge the gap between CTO and CEO.

*   **Orchestrator:** The CAIO does not own all AI projects (which are distributed in product teams) but owns the *Standards*.
*   **Budget Holder:** They hold the centralized budget for expensive compute contracts and foundation model licenses, giving them leverage to enforce compliance. "You want access to the GPU cluster? Show me your Risk Assessment."

## The "Champion" Network

Centralized governance is slow. We need distributed enforcement.

*   **Embedded Ethicists:** Every major product team has a designated "AI Champion"—a senior engineer or product manager trained in the organization's AI principles. They act as the "local sheriff," flagging issues early so the central Council doesn't become a bottleneck.

Governance is the art of slowing down the bad ideas so the good ideas can move fast.
