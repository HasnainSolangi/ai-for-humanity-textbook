# Procurement Policies and Third-Party Vendor Controls

Most organizations will buy AI, not build it. This shifts the risk from "Engineering" to "Procurement."

## Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)

When you buy a SaaS AI tool, you are inheriting their risk.

*   **The Questionnaire:** Before signing, vendors must answer: "What data was this trained on?" "Do you indemnify us against copyright claims?" "Do you use our data to train your other models?"
*   **The "Opt-Out" Clause:** Contracts must guarantee that the enterprise can turn off data sharing. Many "free" AI tools monetize by sucking corporate secrets into their public model. This is a massive IP leak.

## Supply Chain Liability

If your vendor's AI hallucinates and you get sued, who pays?

*   **Indemnification:** Modern AI contracts are battlegrounds over liability caps. A vendor offering a $50/month API will try to cap liability at $50. An enterprise facing a $50M class-action lawsuit cannot accept that.
*   **Insurance:** Cyber-insurance policies are beginning to exclude "Unexplained AI Failure." Organizations must verify their coverage.

## Shadow AI

Employees are using ChatGPT whether you allow it or not.

*   **The "Walled Garden" Strategy:** Instead of banning AI (which leads to employees using it on their personal phones), provides a corporate-sanctioned, secure instance (e.g., Enterprise Bing/ChatGPT) where data is not logged. "Safe AI" is the only cure for "Shadow AI."
