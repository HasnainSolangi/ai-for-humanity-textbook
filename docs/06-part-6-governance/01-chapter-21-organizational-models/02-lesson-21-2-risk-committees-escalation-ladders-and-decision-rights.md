# Risk Committees, Escalation Ladders, and Decision Rights

Not every decision needs to go to the CEO. Efficient governance is about "Right-Sizing" the review.

## The Risk Tiers (Tiering Framework)

We classify every AI project into a tier:

*   **Tier 1 (Critical):** Life-safety impact, legal impact, or massive reputation risk (e.g., Hiring Algorithm, Medical Diagnosis).
    *   *Path:* Full Council Review + External Audit + Board Notification.
*   **Tier 2 (High):** Customer-facing but lower stakes (e.g., Chatbot for FAQs).
    *   *Path:* Divisional Review + Standard Red Teaming.
*   **Tier 3 (Internal/Low):** Helping employees summarize emails.
    *   *Path:* Automated Compliance Check (PII scan) + Manager Approval.

## The Escalation Ladder

When there is a disagreement (e.g., Product wants to launch, Privacy says no), there must be a clear path.

1.  **Level 1:** Product Owner vs. Privacy Engineer. (Try to resolve).
2.  **Level 2:** VP of Product vs. Chief Privacy Officer.
3.  **Level 3:** The CEO (The Tie-Breaker).

## Decision Rights (RACI)

One of the biggest failures in AI governance is ambiguity about who signs the "Launch" certificate.

*   **Responsible:** The Product Manager (Does the work).
*   **Accountable:** The Business GM (The "One Throat to Choke" if it goes wrong).
*   **Consulted:** Legal, Security, Ethics.
*   **Informed:** Sales, Marketing.

Governance is clarity. If you don't know who can say "No," you don't have governance.
