# International Regulations: Overview and Mapping

The "Wild West" era of AI is over. Regulation is global, strict, and fragmented.

## The Brussels Effect: The EU AI Act

The European Union has set the de facto global standard.

*   **Risk-Based Pyramid:**
    *   *Unacceptable Risk:* Social Scoring, Biometric Scanning in Public. **BANNED.**
    *   *High Risk:* Hiring, Medical, Education, Critical Infrastructure. **Strict Conformity Assessment.**
    *   *Limited Risk:* Chatbots, Deepfakes. **Transparency Only** ("I am a bot").
    *   *Minimal Risk:* Spam filters, Games. **No Regulation.**

## The US Approach: Sectoral Guidance

*   **NIST AI RMF:** A voluntary Risk Management Framework that is becoming the standard for defense in court.
*   **Executive Orders:** Mandating safety testing for "Dual Use Foundation Models" (huge models).
*   **Agency Enforcement:** The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) is actively punishing companies for "AI Washing" (lying about capabilities) and "Algorithmic Disgorgement" (forcing companies to delete models trained on stolen data).

## China: Control and Stability

*   **Algorithm Registration:** Companies must file the details of their recommendation algorithms with the CAC (Cyberspace Administration of China).
*   **Generative AI Rules:** Output must align with socialist core values.

Global companies cannot build one product. They must build a "Compliance Layer" that adapts the product to the local law (e.g., turning off Facial Recognition in Europe, turning it on in Asia).
