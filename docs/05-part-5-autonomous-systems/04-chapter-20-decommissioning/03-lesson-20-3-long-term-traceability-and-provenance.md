# Long-Term Traceability and Provenance

Five years from now, when a lawsuit arrives, can you prove why your AI did what it did?

## The Artifact Archive
We must store the "DNA" of every decision.
*   **The Tuple:** `(Input, Output, Model_Hash, Prompt_Version, Timestamp)`.
*   **Storage:** Cold storage (Amazon S3 Glacier). Cheap, slow, durable.

## Provenance Graph
*   **Supply Chain:** "This decision came from Model A. Model A was trained on Dataset B. Dataset B included Image C from Source D."
*   **Copyright Defense:** If accused of copyright infringement, this graph proves (or disproves) that a specific copyrighted work was in the training set.

## Cryptographic Signing
*   **C2PA Standard:** We sign the content generated by our AI. "This image was generated by our model on Date X." This helps combat deepfakes by establishing a chain of trust for *our* authentic content (even if that content is synthetic).

History is written by the victors, but it is proven by the logs.
