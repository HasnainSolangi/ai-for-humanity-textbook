# Pilot, Scale, Embed: The Lifecycle

You do not "flip a switch" on Enterprise AI. It is a biological growth process.

## Phase 1: The Pilot (0 to 1)
*   **Goal:** Prove value. Technical feasibility.
*   **Scope:** One team. 50 users. Restricted data.
*   **Metric:** "Did these 50 users smile?" (Qualitative feedback).
*   **Trap:** "Pilot Purgatory." Doing 50 pilots and never scaling one.

## Phase 2: Scale (1 to 100)
*   **Goal:** Reliability. Economics.
*   **Scope:** One division. 5,000 users. Real production data.
*   **Focus:** MLOps pipelines, Cost Optimization (switching from GPT-4 to Llama 3), Load Testing.
*   **Metric:** Operational stability (Uptime, Latency).

## Phase 3: Embed (100 to Infinity)
*   **Goal:** Cultural transformation. The AI disappears into the background workflow.
*   **Scope:** Global. All users.
*   **Focus:** Governance, Long-term drift monitoring, User proficiency.
*   **Metric:** Business Impact (Revenue, Efficiency, Satisfaction).

Don't skip steps. A pilot that scales too fast breaks the bank. A scaled tool that isn't embedded is abandoned.
