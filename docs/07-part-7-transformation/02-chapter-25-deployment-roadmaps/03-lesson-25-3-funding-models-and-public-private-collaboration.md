# Funding Models and Public-Private Collaboration

AI is expensive. Who pays?

## The CapEx vs. OpEx Shift
Traditional software was CapEx (Buy a server once). generative AI is OpEx (Pay per token forever).
*   **Implication:** Budgets must be dynamic. A "Usage Spike" (viral success) means a "Cost Spike."
*   **Chargeback:** Central IT pays the cloud bill but "charges back" the cost to the department using the tool. This incentivizes departments to be efficient.

## Venture Philanthropy
For "AI for Humanity" projects that lack a profit model.
*   **Impact Investing:** Funds that accept lower financial returns in exchange for measurable social impact.
*   **Compute Grants:** Tech giants (Google, Microsoft) donating millions of dollars in GPU credits to NGOs.

## Public-Private Partnerships (PPP)
*   **Data Trusts:** The Government provides the data (e.g., Traffic Data). The Private Sector provides the compute/talent. The resulting model is a "Public Good" open to all.

We need creative financing to ensure AI benefits aren't privatized while risks are socialized.
