# KPIs, ROI, and Social Impact Measurement

You cannot manage what you do not measure. But measuring AI is tricky.

## Hard ROI (The Accountant's View)
*   **Cost Savings:** "We replaced 50% of Tier 1 tickets with a bot." -> $1M savings.
*   **Revenue Uplift:** "Recommendation engine increased cart size by 5%." -> $2M revenue.
*   **Productivity:** "Coding assistant saves 1 hour per dev per day." -> $5M virtual capacity.

## Soft ROI (The Human View)
*   **Employee Satisfaction (eNPS):** "Do you enjoy your job more now that use AI to scrub data?"
*   **Customer Trust:** "Customer Churn Rate." If efficiency goes up but trust goes down, you are losing value.

## Social Impact Metrics (Double Bottom Line)
For NGOs and Governments:
*   **Access:** "How many more citizens did we serve?"
*   **Equity:** "Did the gap between rich and poor applicants shrink or grow?"

Avoid "Vanity Metrics" like "Number of Prompts Sent." Focus on "Business Outcomes Achieved."
