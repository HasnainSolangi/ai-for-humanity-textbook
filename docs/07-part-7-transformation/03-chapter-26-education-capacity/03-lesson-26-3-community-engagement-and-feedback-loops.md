# Community Engagement and Feedback Loops

Education flows both ways. The community teaches the AI developers what is actually needed.

## The "Living Lab"
Instead of developing in a closed lab, co-locate the dev team in a community center or hospital.
*   **Observation:** Engineers see the chaotic reality of the workflow. "Oh, the nurse doesn't have a free hand to type; we need voice control."

## Citizen Assemblies
For public sector AI (e.g., a city surveillance system).
*   **Method:** Randomly select 100 citizens. Educate them on the pros/cons. Let them deliberate and issue a recommendation.
*   **Result:** Policies that stick because they have democratic legitimacy.

## Recursive Feedback
The system must have a "Report Issue" button that is actually read.
*   **The Ticket:** "This translation was culturally offensive."
*   **The Loop:** The report goes to the retraining queue. The next model version fixes it. The user gets an email: "Thanks to you, we fixed this." This builds massive trust.
