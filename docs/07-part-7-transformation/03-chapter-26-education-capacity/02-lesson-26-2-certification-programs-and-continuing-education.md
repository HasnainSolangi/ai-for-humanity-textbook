# Certification Programs and Continuing Education

How do we prove someone is qualified to oversee a lethal AI system?

## Professional Licenses
Current licenses (Medical Board, Bar Exam) do not cover AI.
*   **Update Required:** Continuing Medical Education (CME) credits must include mandatory AI modules. You shouldn't leverage an AI diagnostic tool if you haven't passed the module on its failure modes.

## The "AI Driver's License"
For high-risk roles (e.g., HR Managers using AI hiring tools), we need a specific license.
*   **Test:** "Here is a biased output. Spot the bias." "Here is a hallucination. Spot the error."
*   **Renewal:** Must be re-taken annually as the models change.

## Organizational Badging
Internal badges ("Certified Prompt Engineer," "Certified AI Risk Auditor"). These gamify the learning process and identify the internal experts.
