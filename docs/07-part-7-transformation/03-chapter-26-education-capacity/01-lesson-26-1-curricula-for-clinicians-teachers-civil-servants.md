# Curricula for Clinicians, Teachers, Civil Servants

We don't need to teach doctors how to code Python. We need to teach them how to *collaborate* with AI.

## The "AI Literacy" Core
Every professional needs to understand:
1.  **Capabilities:** What is this tool good at? (Summarization, Pattern Matching).
2.  **Limitations:** What is it bad at? (Math, Fact Verification, Context).
3.  **Ethics:** When should I not use it? (Bias, Privacy).

## Sector Tracks

*   **Clinicians:** "Interpreting Probabilistic Risk Scores." "Recognizing Artifacts in AI Medical Imaging." "Patient Consent Conversations."
*   **Teachers:** "Detecting AI Plagiarism (and why it might not matter)." "Using AI to generate Lesson Plans." "Teaching Critical Thinking vs. AI."
*   **Civil Servants:** "Procurement of Safe AI." "Algorithmic Due Process." "Data Privacy Laws."

## Just-in-Time Learning
The field moves too fast for a 4-year degree. We need "Micro-Credentials" and "Nano-Degrees" that update every 6 months.
