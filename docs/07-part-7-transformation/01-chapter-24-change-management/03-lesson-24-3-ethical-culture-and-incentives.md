# Ethical Culture and Incentives

"Show me the incentive, and I will show you the outcome." — Charlie Munger.
If you pay engineers to ship fast, they will ship unsafe AI.

## Misaligned Incentives

*   **The "Launch Bonus":** If a PM gets a bonus for "launching Q3," they will ignore the bias report that suggests a delay to Q4.
*   **The "Accuracy Trap":** If a Data Scientist is promoted based on "Model Accuracy," they will overfit the model or leak data to get a higher number.

## Designing Ethical Incentives

*   **The "Safety Brake" Award:** Give a bonus to the engineer who *stopped* a launch because they found a safety flaw. This signals that safety is valued more than speed.
*   **Long-Term Vesting:** Tie executive bonuses not just to "Launch," but to "No major scandals 1 year post-launch."

## Psychological Safety

Engineers must feel safe to say "This looks dangerous."
*   **Anonymous Reporting:** An "Ethics Hotline" for algorithmic concerns.
*   **Blameless Post-Mortems:** When things go wrong, focus on the process failure, not the person. If you fire the whistleblower, the next whistleblower stays silent.

Culture is what happens when no one is looking.
