# Training People: Upskilling and Role Redesign

AI will not replace humans, but humans with AI will replace humans without AI. The responsibility of the organization is to ensure the "humans without AI" group is zero.

## The Reskilling Imperative

*   **The "Hollow Middle":** AI tends to automate the middle-skill tasks (data entry, basic coding, report drafting).
*   **The New Ladder:** We must create a path from "Data Entry Clerk" to "Data Steward" (who manages the data quality) or "AI Exception Handler" (who fixes the 10% of cases the AI misses).
*   **Training Budget:** Best-in-class organizations allocate 1% of total payroll to AI upskilling. It is cheaper to retrain a loyal employee than to fire them and hire a scarce AI expert.

## Role Redesign Examples

*   **Customer Support:** FROM "Reading scripts to angry customers" TO "Reviewing draft responses generated by AI and adding empathy."
*   **Radiologist:** FROM "Scanning for nodules" TO "Integrating AI findings with patient history to determine treatment plans."
*   **Software Engineer:** FROM "Writing boilerplate CSS" TO "Architecting complex systems and auditing AI-generated code."

## Managing the Fear

The #1 blocker to AI adoption is not technology; it is fear of job loss.
*   **The "No Layoff" Pledge:** Companies that promise "No layoffs due to AI implementation" (relocation instead) see 3x faster adoption rates. Employees will sabotage an AI system if they think it is training their replacement.
