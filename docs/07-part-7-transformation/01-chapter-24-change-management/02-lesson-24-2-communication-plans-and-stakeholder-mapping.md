# Communication Plans and Stakeholder Mapping

AI transformation is a political campaign. You must win hearts and minds.

## Stakeholder Mapping

Who cares about this project?

*   **The Sponsor:** The Executive who pays for it. (Cares about ROI).
*   **The User:** The frontline worker. (Cares about "Does this make my job harder?").
*   **The Skeptic:** The Compliance Officer or Union Rep. (Cares about Risk).
*   **The Beneficiary:** The Customer/Citizen. (Cares about Service Quality).

## The Narrative Arc

You must control the story.

*   **Bad Narrative:** "We are deploying AI to cut costs by 30%." (Translation: Firing people).
*   **Good Narrative:** "We are deploying AI to eliminate the backend paperwork so you can spend 30% more time with clients." (Translation: Improving work-life balance and value).

## The Rhythm of Communication

*   **Town Halls:** Open Q&A where leadership addresses fears directly.
*   **Demo Days:** Show, don't tell. A live demo of the tool saving someone 2 hours of work is worth 100 emails.
*   **The "Fail Wall":** Celebrate mistakes. If a pilot fails, publish a "Lessons Learned" article. This builds psychological safety.
