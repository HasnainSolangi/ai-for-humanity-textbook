# Public Trust, Transparency, and Accountability

Government is the only service provider you cannot opt out of. When a private company deploys a biased algorithm, you can switch competitors. When a government does it, it can deny you benefits, liberty, or due process. Therefore, the "Trust Bar" for public sector AI is significantly higher than for the private sector.

## The Legitimacy Crisis

Trust in public institutions is already fragile. AI has the potential to either repair this trust through efficiency or shatter it through oppression.

*   **The "Black Box" Ban:** In a democracy, citizens have a right to know how decisions about them are made. A government agency cannot say, "We denied your housing application because the algorithm said so." There must be a plain-language explanation that cites specific policy criteria.
*   **Algorithmic Due Process:** Traditional due process allows a citizen to face their accuser. In the AI age, this means the right to challenge the data and the logic used by the system. Agencies must have a formal "Appeals Process" specifically designed for algorithmic decisions.

## Radical Transparency

Transparency is the best disinfectant.

*   **Public Algorithmic Registers:** Leading governments (like Amsterdam and Helsinki) publish a public "registry" of all AI systems in use. Each entry details: What the system does, what data it uses, who owns it, and when it was last audited.
*   **Open Source Reference Implementations:** Wherever possible, the logic (if not the data) should be open source. This allows academic and civil society watchdogs to audit the code for systemic bias or security flaws.

## Accountability Structures

Who goes to jail when the AI breaks the law?

*   **The "Human-in-the-Loop" Legal Shield:** By law, critical decisions (arrests, benefit denials) usually require a human signature. This ensures there is always a human legally responsible for the outcome, preventing the "The computer made a mistake" defense.
*   **Impact Assessments:** Before procuring an AI system, agencies must run a Human Rights Impact Assessment (HRIA) to predict potential negative externalities on vulnerable populations.

Public sector AI must operate in the light. It is not enough to be efficient; it must be just.
