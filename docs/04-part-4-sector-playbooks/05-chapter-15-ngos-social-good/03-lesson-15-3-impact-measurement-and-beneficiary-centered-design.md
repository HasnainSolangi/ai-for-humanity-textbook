# Impact Measurement and Beneficiary-Centered Design

In the social sector, the "User" (the aid worker) is different from the "Beneficiary" (the person receiving aid). We must design for both, but prioritize the latter.

## Measuring What Matters

Metrics like "Monthly Active Users" are irrelevant to social impact.

*   **Outcome Metrics:** Instead of "Number of AI diagnoses performed," measure "Reduction in untreated malaria cases."
*   **Counterfactual Analysis:** We must ask, "Would this positive outcome have happened anyway without the AI?" Rigorous A/B testing (Randomized Control Trials - RCTs) helps isolate the AI's true contribution.

## Beneficiary Feedback Loops

The people affected by the AI often have no voice in its design.

*   **Participatory Design:** Involve the community from Day 1. Don't build *for* them; build *with* them. Co-design workshops helps uncover local constraints that a remote engineer would never guess (e.g., "The color red means death in this culture, don't use it for the 'Save' button").
*   **Grievance Mechanisms:** There must be a clear, offline channel for beneficiaries to complain if the AI system makes a mistake (e.g., wrongly excluding them from a food distribution list).

## Sustainability

The graveyard of "Tech for Good" is filled with pilots that worked for 6 months and died when the grant ran out.

*   **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):** Who pays for the server costs when the donor leaves? Systems must be designed for financial sustainability, perhaps using low-cost, open-source infrastructure that the local government or NGO can afford to maintain long-term.

True impact is not about the sophistication of the model; it is about the sustainability of the solution.
