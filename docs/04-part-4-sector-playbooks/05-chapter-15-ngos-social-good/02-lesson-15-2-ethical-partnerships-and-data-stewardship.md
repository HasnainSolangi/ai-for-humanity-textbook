# Ethical Partnerships and Data Stewardship

Humanitarian organizations are often data-rich but tech-poor. Tech companies are tech-rich but context-poor. Partnering is necessary, but it is fraught with "Data Colonialism" risks.

## The Power Imbalance

When a tech giant offers "Free AI" to an NGO, who owns the data?

*   **Data Extraction vs. Value Creation:** If the tech company uses the NGO's sensitive data (e.g., photos of malnourished children) primarily to improve its commercial algorithms, that is exploitative. The partnership must deliver immediate, tangible value to the beneficiaries on the ground.
*   **Capacity Building:** The goal should be to transfer knowledge, not just software. Tech partners should train local staff to maintain the systems, avoiding strict dependency.

## Data Stewardship for Vulnerable Populations

Collecting data on refugees or victims of violence carries extreme risk. If that database leaks, people could be targeted or killed.

*   **Data Minimization at the Source:** Do not collect "Religion" or "Ethnicity" unless absolutely necessary for the aid intervention. If the data doesn't exist, it can't be stolen.
*   **The "Do No Harm" Audit:** Before deploying a system, we must ask: "How could a hostile actor misuse this?" (e.g., using a satellite crop-analysis tool to locate and bomb food supplies).

## Informed Consent in Crisis

How do you get valid consent from a starving person?

*   **Non-Coercive Opt-In:** Aid must never be conditional on providing data for AI training. There must always be a non-digital, non-surveilled option for receiving help.
*   **Community Consent:** In many cultures, individual consent is secondary to community or elder consent. Engagement must respect local governance structures.

Ethical AI applies the Hippocratic Oath to data: First, do no harm.
