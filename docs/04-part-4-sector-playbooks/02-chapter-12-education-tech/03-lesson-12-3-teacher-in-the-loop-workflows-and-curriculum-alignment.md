# Teacher-in-the-Loop Workflows and Curriculum Alignment

The narrative of "AI replacing teachers" is fundamentally flawed. Education is a relationship, not a transaction. The role of AI is to automate the drudgery (grading, scheduling, lesson planning) so the teacher can focus on the humanity (mentorship, emotional support, inspiration).

## The AI Co-Pilot for Teachers

*   **Automated Lesson Planning:** AI can generate a lesson plan on "Photosynthesis" tailored to 5th graders, complete with quizzes, metaphors, and image prompts, in seconds. The teacher then critiques and customizes it. This saves hours of prep time.
*   **The Grading Assistant:** AI can provide first-pass feedback on essay drafts, analyzing grammar and structure. The teacher then focuses their energy on the higher-level critique of the argument and voice.
*   **The Dashboard:** Teachers don't need raw data; they need insights. "Class, pay attention to Sarah—she's failing to understand Quadratic Equations, while the rest of the class has moved on." This allows for targeted micro-interventions.

## Curriculum Alignment

AI must serve the curriculum, not the other way around.

*   **Standard Mapping:** AI-generated content must be explicitly mapped to state or national standards (e.g., Common Core). A generator that produces "cool math problems" that don't align with the test requirements is a distraction.
*   **Factuality & Safety:** In a classroom, hallucination is unacceptable. We use "Retrieval Augmented Generation" (RAG) grounded in approved textbooks to ensure the AI tutor doesn't teach incorrect history or science.

By keeping the teacher in the loop as the "Editor-in-Chief" and "Lead Mentor," we get the scale of AI with the heart of a human educator.
