# Student Data Protections and Equity in Personalization

Schools are custodians of the future. The data generated by students—their grades, behavioral notes, and learning patterns—determines their life opportunities. We must handle this data with extreme care to prevent algorithmic tracking that permanently pigeonholes children.

## Data Governance (FERPA / COPPA)

*   **Strict Purpose Limitations:** Student data collected for "improving algebra skills" cannot be sold to advertisers or used to market loans to their parents. Legal frameworks (like FERPA in the US) strictly prohibit non-educational secondary use.
*   **The Permanent Record:** We must be wary of creating an unshakeable digital history. If a student struggles in 3rd grade, that data shouldn't bias the AI against them in high school. "Data Sunsetting" policies ensure that students get a fresh start at key varying stages.

## Algorithmic Bias in Education

Bias in education amplifies inequality across generations.

*   **Prediction vs. Potential:** A model predicting "Dropout Risk" might flag students from low-income zip codes as "High Risk." If the intervention is "Give them extra tutoring," that's good. If the intervention is "Steer them away from AP classes," that is algorithmic redlining. We must ensure predictions trigger *support*, not *gatekeeping*.
*   **Content Diversity:** AI tutors must be trained on diverse cultural contexts. Word problems shouldn't only feature western names or scenarios. Representation in the curriculum helps students feel belonging.

## The Digital Divide

AI-powered personalized learning is resource-intensive.

*   **Hardware Access:** If the AI requiring a high-end laptop, low-income students are excluded. We must optimize for lightweight web clients and mobile-first experiences.
*   **Bandwidth Constraints:** Offline-first architecture allows students to download the week's personalized lesson pack at school and work on it at home without internet access.

Equity means designing systems that lift the floor for the most vulnerable, rather than just raising the ceiling for the privileged.
