# Adaptive Learning and Assessment Integrity

Education is arguably the highest-leverage application for AI. The "2 Sigma Problem" posits that 1-on-1 tutoring can raise an average student to the 98th percentile. AI makes 1-on-1 tutoring scalable to millions. However, it also threatens the traditional methods of assessing knowledge. This lesson explores the duality of Personalized Learning vs. Academic Integrity.

## Adaptive Learning Engines

Adaptive learning moves away from the "Factory Model" of education (everyone learns the same thing at the same time).

*   **Knowledge Tracing (BKT/DKT):** Bayesian Knowledge Tracing models track a student's mastery of specific concepts (e.g., "Understanding Fractions"). As the student solves problems, the model updates its probability estimate of their mastery.
*   **Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD):** The AI dynamically serves content that is "just hard enough." If the student struggles, it scaffolds down to remedial concepts. If they breeze through, it accelerates to advanced material. This keeps the student in the "Flow Channel," maximizing engagement and learning velocity.

## Assessment Integrity in the Age of GenAI

If an AI can write an essay in seconds, the "Take-Home Essay" is dead as an assessment tool. We must rethink how we measure learning.

*   **Process over Product:** We stop grading the final essay; we grade the *process* of writing it. Tools that track the version history of a document (keystroke dynamics, edit time) can prove that a human wrote it.
*   **Oral Exams at Scale:** AI voice agents can conduct 10-minute "Oral Defense" interviews with every student, asking them to explain their code or their thesis. This tests deep understanding, which is much harder to fake than a written submission.
*   **AI-Resistant Assessments:** Moving from simple factual recall (which AI is great at) to critical synthesis, personal reflection, and novel problem solving in controlled environments.

## The Goal: Mastery Learning

The ultimate shift is from "Time-Based Education" (sit in class for 9 months -> get a C) to "Mastery-Based Education" (keep working until you get an A). AI provides the infinite patience and infinite variations of practice problems required to support this model, ensuring that no student is left behind simply because they needed a few more weeks to grasp a concept.
