# AI for Humanity - Project Constitution

## Core Mandate
To provide a complete, actionable framework for deploying AI systems that prioritize **wellbeing**, **equity**, and **human dignity** within institutional contexts.

## Guiding Principles

### 1. Human Dignity First
AI systems must respect human agency and dignity. Automation should serve to enhance human potential, not replace or demean it.

### 2. Equity by Design
Fairness and non-discrimination are operational requirements, not afterthoughts. We design for the most vulnerable users to ensure systems work for everyone.

### 3. Wellbeing over Efficiency
Optimization metrics must include human wellbeing. Efficiency gains should not come at the cost of mental health, social cohesion, or environmental sustainability.

### 4. Enterprise Reliability
Responsible AI must be reliable AI. We apply rigorous engineering practices (testing, monitoring, security) to ethical considerations.

## Tech Stack (Updated)
- **Frontend**: Docusaurus + React + Tailwind CSS.
- **RAG Engine**: Qdrant (Vector DB) + Cohere (Embeddings/Rerank).
- **Navigation**: "Mobile-First" No-Hamburger Layout.

## Content Rules (The "No Code" Decree)
- **Strictly Non-Coding**: This is a textbook for *concepts*, not a coding tutorial.
- **Snippets**: Only minimal, production-accurate snippets allowed for context.
- **Agent-First**: Assume the reader uses an AI Agent to write the actual code.

## Working Agreement
- **Code is Law**: We implement these principles directly into code, architecture, and configuration.
- **Evidence-Based**: We rely on proven patterns and verifiable metrics.
- **Continuous Improvement**: The framework evolves as technology and society change.
